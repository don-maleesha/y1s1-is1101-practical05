In this repository, I have implemented several tasks. 
In the "practical1.c" file, the goal is to take input from the user for two numbers and then determine the maximum between these two numbers using the switch case construct.
In the "practical2.c" file, a C program is included to develop a straightforward calculator for executing fundamental arithmetic operations utilizing a switch case. The calculator prompts the user to input two numbers and an operator. Subsequently, it performs the operation based on the entered operator, adhering to a specified input format.
